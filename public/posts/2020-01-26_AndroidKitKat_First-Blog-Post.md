This is the first blog post, and will serve as an example on how to write blog posts for the future
# PBUI Project Blog Tutorial!

This is the first blog post that is written on the pbui.codes website.

It's super easy and fun to write blog posts, and this blog post will serve as a demonstration on how to write blog posts on the website.

Since this a completely custom solution to blogs, there are few quirks in how to format and write posts.

Big thing to note: blogs are markdown, so any and all markdown solutions will work. This includes inline CSS/HTML for formatting.

### First rule:

Blog posts must have a very specific naming convention for the file name. It should be

`YYYY-MM-DD_YOURNAME_POSTTITLE.md`

My program delimits fields based on underscores, so make sure you name your files accordingly. There can **NOT** be spaces in your name and the post name.

### Second rule:

The first line of your blog post /needs/ to contain a blurb about your post. My software looks for it, and very much expects it to be there.

This line will not get rendered in the actual post, only on the preview screen.

There are no other major rules, other than to have fun while writing them.
